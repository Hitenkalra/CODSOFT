# üéÆ Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a simple yet powerful implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe game**, where you can play against an **unbeatable AI**.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to always make the optimal move, making it a fun way to experience **game theory** and **AI search algorithms** in action.

## ‚ú® Features
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI that never loses.
- Implemented using the **Minimax Algorithm** (with pruning for efficiency).
- Runs entirely in the **command line** (no extra setup required).
- Beginner-friendly project to understand **AI in games**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. The board is displayed in a 3x3 grid.
2. You (the human player) choose your move by entering a position.
3. The AI calculates the **best possible move** using Minimax.
4. The game continues until someone wins or the board is full.
